The entry point is on Gameplay.bb

For loops are inclusive, For i = 0 to 99 is the same as for i in 0..=99 in odin. Dim takes the last index of its elements, not the size of the array, So Dim arr(9) means there are 10 elements.
Mat is using arrays wrong. Hes starting from index 1 instead of 0, and most of his arrays are too long with elements never used. My theory is that he uses the 0 index for as an invalid type, and was too lazy to cap the array size to their supposed size.
I can keep the indexing the same in odin. Just set the array size to one less, and change the loops to inclusive.
